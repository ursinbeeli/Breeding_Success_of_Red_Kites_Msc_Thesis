## Things to discuss

- The low number of birds with ground truth is partly explainable with the fact, that I only considered birds with an according nest id to allow measures such as distance to nest, revisits, etc. <br> This lowers the number of birds from 296 to 58.

- I changed the age column to a format with following categories: 1CY, 2CY & 3CY (CY = Calendar Year) (3CY means 2 and older)
