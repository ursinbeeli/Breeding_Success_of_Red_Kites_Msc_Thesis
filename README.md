# Determining the Breeding Success of Red Kites (*Milvus milvus*) using GPS Telemetry

### This repository serves as a place where I store my R scripts and track my progress.

In my masterâ€™s thesis, the breeding behaviour of red kites (*Milvus milvus*) is analysed based on GPS point data collected by the Swiss Ornithological Institute. In particular, the aim is to determine individual aspects of the breeding cycle in order to evaluate the breeding success of red kites by developing a model that allows for detailed fine-tuning to account for the heterogeneity of behavioural patterns of individuals within a population.
